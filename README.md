# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

## Overview
This repository hosts a machine learning project to predict cardiovascular diseases using various patient data. The goal is to leverage health data to predict potential heart issues before they become severe, enabling preemptive healthcare measures.

## Features
- **Data Analysis:** Explore and visualize patient data to identify key patterns and correlations.
- **Model Training:** Implement machine learning algorithms to train predictive models based on patient records.
- **Prediction:** Utilize trained models to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases.
- **Validation:** Assess model accuracy and performance with real-world data.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8+
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for model building
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Installation
